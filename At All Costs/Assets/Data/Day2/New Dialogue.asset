  - text: 'You need to match the correct coloured wires together. Click a wire to
      select it then click the wire you want to connect it to. The wires need to be
      connected in a certain order. If a wire is connected in the incorrect order
      it will disconnect all wires so remember the order you connect them in. You
      only have 30 seconds to connect the wires before the circuit shorts but you
      can retry if this happens. '
